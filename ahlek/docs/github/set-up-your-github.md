# 2. Set Up Your GitHub.com Account

For this class, we will use a public account on GitHub.com. We do this for a few reasons:

We don't want you to "practice" in repositories that contain real code.
We are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix them. (therefore, refer to the bullet above)
You can set up your free account by following these steps:

1. Access GitHub.com and click Sign up.

2. Choose the free account.

3. You will receive a verification email at the address provided.

4. Click the link to complete the verification process.

If you already have an account, verify that you can visit github.com within your organization's network.

GitHub is designed to run on the current versions of all major browsers. In particular, if you use Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE), you must be using the latest version. Take a look at our list of [supported browsers](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/supported-browsers).
